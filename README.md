<!-- ## Monologue

I'm sure that if you're finding yourself upon this repository that you do not need an introduction to BotW, so I will get straight to the point.  
Some people play the game for the experience. The joy and entertainment one feels as they sink hours upon hours of exploring the game's endless content and discovering every possible little secret hiding behind every rock.  
As a TASer, we feel no such enjoyment. The satisfaction we seek comes from desecrating our most cherished games to the mill of speedrunning. But, not so fast, we're no average speedrunners.  
We're tenacious. We spend hours over every few frames finding the perfect angle to bounce that boi, and inventing entire new methods of movement just because we have a program that will spam the A button frame-perfectly for literal hours on end.

Anyways, enough with the explanation of the art. Enjoy going through the repository and finding all of the scripts. -->
